# Introduction 
The XAI program is initiated and supported by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which aims to help end-users understand the rationale of AI system's decisions. We [Texas A&M University (TAMU)](https://www.tamu.edu/) performer team lists several project outcomes in this page, which could be potentially integrated into the final DARPA XAI Toolkit.
